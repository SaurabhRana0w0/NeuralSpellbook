# NeuralSpellbook 🧠📚

*A curated collection of intelligence spells, prompt frameworks, and AI control techniques.*

> **Turn thoughts into command.**


## 🚀 Overview

NeuralSpellbook is a structured library of prompt patterns, frameworks, and advanced thinking instructions designed to help you control AI models with precision — not luck.

Whether you're building software, generating visuals, conducting scientific research, or pushing the limits of reasoning — this spellbook gives you repeatable prompt structures instead of random guesswork.

### 🧩 General  
Prompts for everyday usage — rewriting, persona creation, productivity, organization, communication tone control, etc.

### 🛠️ Development  
Prompts for coding, debugging, refactoring, code documentation, secure coding, software architecture, and system design.

### 🧪 Research  
Scientific reasoning, summarization frameworks, academic analysis, hypothesis generation, and fact-driven structured outputs.

### 🎨 Creative  
Image prompts, video prompts, storywriting modes, branding frameworks, tone-style converters, and creative thinking templates.

### 🧬 Advanced Reasoning  
Chain-of-thought simulation, Socratic multi-pass reasoning, planning agents, evaluator mode, multi-persona analysis, and autonomous frameworks.

### 🗝️ Templates  
Reusable blank structures for any category — plug-and-play format.

## ⚠️ Philosophy

This is **not** a random prompt dump.

Every entry must follow:

- ⬜ **Purpose**  
- ⬜ **When to use**  
- ⬜ **Prompt**  
- ⬜ **Variants / Modes**  
- ⬜ **Example Output**  

If it doesn’t teach, scale, or repeat — it doesn’t belong here.

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs welcome — but must follow structure.  
Chaos stays at the door.

## 🔥 Future Plans

- Versioning (v1 → v2…)
- Downloadable cards PDF
- Web interactive version (later)
- Multi-model mode support (Claude / GPT / Gemini / Local LLMs)
